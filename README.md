# An Entanglement-Aware Middleware for Cyber-Physical Systems: Artifacts

This repository contains the artifacts described in the paper titled "An Entanglement-Aware Middleware for Cyber-Physical Systems."
This repository hosts any relevant artifacts that we used during our research. 
It serves to increase the reproducibility and understanding of our work.

This repository is structured as follows:
```
./
├── entanglement-aware-middleware/        # Source code of the entanglement-aware middleware for cyber-physical systems
├── experiments/                          # Scripts, configuration files, and instructions to reproduce the experiments
├── iiot-device/                          # Source code of the IIoT device emulator
├── kubemake/                             # Source code of the Ansible project to automatically configure the testbed
├── wldt-composed-digital-twin-mqtt/      # Source code of the entanglement-aware digital twins
├── wldt-digital-twin-mqtt/               # Source code of the entanglement-aware digital twins (composed version)
└── README.md                             # This file
